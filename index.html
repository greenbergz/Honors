    <h1>Guidelines for Latin Honors in French, Italian, and Spanish</h1>
    <p1> Starting with the class of 2015, there will be three types of academic recognition that an Arts & Sciences student may receive upon graduation: College Honors, Latin Honors, and Departmental  (“English”) honors. </p>
    <li> College Honors are automatically awarded to all Arts & Sciences students who graduate with an 8th-semester, overall GPA of 3.5 or higher and who have not participated in a department’s Latin Honors program. This designation is noted on a student’s transcript.</li>
    <li>Latin Honors (cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude) are awarded by the College on the basis of GPA. Latin Honors require the completion of a thesis or of honors by coursework. These honors are printed on the diploma and on the transcript.</li>
    <li>Departmental (“English”) Honors are awarded at the department’s discretion as an acknowledgment of the satisfactory completion of a thesis or honors by coursework. This notation appears on the transcript, but not the diploma.</li>
    <p1>Guidelines for Latin and Departmental Honors in French, Italian, and Spanish</p1>
    <h2> </h2>
    <p1> I.General Requirements set by the College of Arts & Sciences </p1>
    <p1> a.Latin Honors are determined on the basis of a student's performance throughout eight semesters in the college. To be eligible for such honors, the student must have maintained a 3.65 grade point average through the sixth semester and must be accepted for candidacy by the relevant department or program. Latin Honors candidates must enroll in such courses as their department or program may require, satisfactorily complete a significant project appropriate to the nature of the discipline, and pass such written and/or oral examinations as the department or program may set. To earn such honors, they must also have maintained the minimum 3.65 grade point average through the final semester.</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1> b.Upon certification by the department that the Honors program has been satisfactorily completed, the student may be awarded the A.B.cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude according to the following proportions: the top 15 percent in overall grade point average of Latin honors candidates who complete the necessary requirements of their major departments will graduate summa cum laude; the next 35 percent magna cum laude; the next 50 percent cum laude.</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1> c. To be eligible for Latin Honors, transfer students must have earned a minimum of 48 letter-graded Washington University units prior to the final semester. Grades earned at other institutions do not figure in the calculation of minimum averages required for eligibility for Latin Honors.</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1> d.In addition to the General Requirements set by the College of Arts & Sciences for the college-wide Honors Program, eligibility and participation in the Latin Honors Program of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures is determined as described below.</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1> II. Departmental Requirments </p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1> a.Students may achieve Latin and Departmental Honors in French, Italian or Spanish by fulfilling all of the requirements of either of two tracks, detailed below. Students wishing to obtain Honors should consult their major advisors early to ensure that they will be eligible.</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1> i. Honors by Coursework</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1> 1. Undergraduates who have maintained a GPA of 3.5 or higher are eligible to earn Honors through coursework. Those interested in doing so should declare their intention in the Fall of their Junior year and select their courses accordingly. All students will be required to take two additional 400-level courses in French or Spanish beyond the major requirements. These courses must be taught in the target language or approved by the Honors coordinator. The additional courses must be completed in the Spring semester of the Junior year and the Fall semester of the Senior year. Students should inform the professors of the two additional courses of their intent to complete Honors through coursework. The professors of the courses will supervise the student’s written work accordingly. Topics for the written work completed for the courses should be chosen with a view towards subsequent expansion of the assignment.</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1> 2.Once the coursework has been completed and a grade for the course has been assigned, the student will be asked to expand the written work for each course by an additional 7-10 pages, which should include the consultation and application of critical and theoretical texts if the student has not already done so. The student will thus complete an additional 14-20 pages in all, above and beyond the written work required for the two courses. The student will then submit the two revised, expanded papers to an Honors committee comprised of the professors of the student’s two additional courses as well as the professor in charge of Honors by coursework. The committee will meet in mid-March to discuss the student’s written work and the student will be given a one-hour oral examination based on the two papers. The committee will then determine the level of departmental Honors the student has merited.</p1>
    <h2></h2>

    <p1> ii. Honors by Thesis </p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1> 1.Students who wish to do a sustained research project should consult with a faculty member in their area of interest in the Junior year, keeping in mind that it may take some time to find an appropriate advisor for the project. The student should then draft a thesis proposal (1-2 pp) in which he or she describes the nature of the project. The project advisor, as well as the major advisor, should then sign the proposal indicating approval. The signed proposal should be submitted to the Honors program faculty coordinator by early April; candidates will be notified of their acceptance by the end of April. Students who plan to study abroad during their Junior year are strongly encouraged to initiate contact with potential thesis advisors before going abroad, as the process may be significantly more difficult once they have left campus. Any exceptions to the April deadline require the consensus of the Honors coordinator, the thesis director and the Director of Undergraduate Studies.</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1> 2. If accepted, candidates for Honors by thesis should consult their thesis advisors about a research plan for the summer and should enroll in Honors 4951 (three credits, Pass/Fail) in the Fall. In 4951, students will meet in regular tutorials with their thesis advisors and draft a significant portion of the thesis. If their work in the Fall is satisfactory, they will be allowed to enroll in Honors 495 (three credits, for a letter grade) in the Spring, in which they will complete a sustained critical study, about fifty pages long, in the language of their major.</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1> 3. A defensible draft of the complete thesis is due before Spring Break, at least two weeks before the defense date. An oral examination (defense) must be held before the College of Arts & Sciences deadline for Honors Certification, which generally falls around the 25th of March. The thesis examining committee consists of three faculty members: the thesis advisor, the second reader, and the faculty coordinator of the Honors program. Students should anticipate making final revisions to the thesis after the defense. They will submit the final version to the Department by mid-April.</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1> b.Honors Designations</p1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p1> At the end of the oral examination, based on their assessment of the quality of the student’s written work and oral defense, Honors examining committees will award the student one of the three following designations:</p1>
    <li> Departmental Honors with High Distinction</li>
    <li>Departmental Honors with Distinction</li>
    <li>Departmental Honors</li>
